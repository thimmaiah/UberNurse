  	| role=Care Giver;verified=true   |	3		| 7.5				|
  	| role=Care Giver;verified=true   |	5		| 25				|
  	| role=Care Giver;verified=true   |	8		| 80				|
	| role=Nurse;verified=true   	  |	3		| 45				|
  	| role=Nurse;verified=true   	  |	5		| 125				|
  	| role=Nurse;verified=true   	  |	8		| 400				|
